This is a toy project in which we will implement the [ECDSA Signature verification algorithm]
bottom-up, step-by-step, in multiple languages.

[ECDSA Signature verification algorithm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm#Signature_verification_algorithm

Each commit will add another function, from the bottom all the way up to the
final ecdsa_verify() function.

The ECDSA verify Python3 code, which all the translations to other languages
is based upon, has been extracted from the [ecdsa-python](https://github.com/starkbank/ecdsa-python)
pure Python3 project developed by [Stark Bank S.A.](https://starkbank.com/)
